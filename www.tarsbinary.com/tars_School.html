            Our aim is to build a self-sustaining ecosystem that will shape our
            youths’ future with innovation driven practical skills. TARS
            Engineering School has built a structure that will not only make our
            youths self-motivated & skill driven but also help to create values
            for a more compassionate community. That will help them to secure
            their dreams and achievements. As the name suggests, we are mainly
            focused on Technical Learning, Business Learning, Software skills
            including ethical learning also. This overall process through
            capacity building will make the community empowered and
            self-dependent. As per the design, when the educational plan of
            <span class="w3-tag">TARS Engineering School</span> is successful, a
            number of students and enthusiasts will be acquired who will be
            skilled in technical skills as basic programming, web development,
            robotics, IoT and work-ethics, from the rural areas of Bangladesh.
            In their young ages they will be prepared to work in the IT sector
            fulltime or part-time, besides their regular education.

          </h3>
          <p>
            It is evident from the current scenario of technical education in
            Bangladesh that there is an absence of a proper education structure
            that can meet the practical needs of youth in those areas. If they
            can be provided with more vocational and skill-based education from
            earlier phases of their education, they can make themselves able to
            meet the financial needs of their family and themselves. There’s
            where <span class="w3-tag">TARS Engineering School</span> steps in,
            making a complete structure of skill-driven education that can be
            provided to students in the rural areas besides their regular
            education in school and madrasas. The plan and design TES suggests
            appear to be promising in solving the current situation and also
            coming up with an ecosystem that may bring up more technical persons
            for bigger work-force.

          <p>
            When we look upon the enormous potential our country holds in the
            young population, we find the motivation to risk and push forward to
            bring about more initiatives like this that can provide them the
            opportunity they deserve.
